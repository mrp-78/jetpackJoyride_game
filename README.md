# jetpackJoyride_game
<b> JetpackJoyride_game </b> is a desktop game inspired by <i>Android jetpack joyride (by Halfbrick Studio)</i> created using SDL. <br><br>
I write this game as my final project of Computer Fundamentals and Programming course in Shahid Behesti University (<b>SBU</b>) with c++ programming language and SDL.<br><br>
